# Iris-Flower-Classification


From the Iris Flower Classification project, here are the key learnings:


Objective: The goal was to classify iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.


Data Handling:


Libraries: Used numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
Data Import: Loaded the iris dataset from a CSV file and examined the structure using functions like head(), tail(), and shape().


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distribution and relationships using histograms and scatter plots.
Created pairwise scatter plots to understand feature interactions and species separation.


Data Preprocessing:

Checked for null values and performed label encoding to convert categorical labels into numerical values.
Split the dataset into training and test sets for model evaluation.
Applied feature scaling to standardize the feature values.


Model Development:

Decision Tree Classifier: Built and evaluated a decision tree model, visualized decision boundaries, and assessed performance using a confusion matrix.
KNN Algorithm: Implemented k-nearest neighbors classifier, evaluated accuracy, RMSE, and R2 score.
SVM: Trained a Support Vector Machine model and evaluated its performance.
Logistic Regression: Developed a logistic regression model and assessed its accuracy and error metrics.
Naive Bayes: Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes, evaluated its performance, and compared it with other models.


Model Evaluation:

Used metrics like accuracy, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate model performance.
Visualized training and test set results to understand model behavior and decision boundaries.


Overall, the project demonstrated the end-to-end process of data handling, exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using multiple classification algorithms for the Iris dataset.
